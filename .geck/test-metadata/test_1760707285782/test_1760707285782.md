## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial curiosity/confidence turns into early visual doubt (cluttered, unfinished UI). Confidence drops sharply when the primary input field is missing, becoming frustration and abandonment.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch the application (Step 1) | ‚úÖ pass | User opens http://localhost:8501 .; Visual audit immediately flags 5/9 layout-and-style checks as ‚Äúlooks off‚Äù (poor alignment, weak hierarchy, inconsistent buttons, mis-aligned form labels, uneven padding). |
| Enter loan amount (Step 2) | ‚ùå fail | User tries to type a loan amount but the input field is not present in the DOM.; Hard failure stops the flow; remaining steps (interest rate, term, Calculate, verify result, screenshot) never run.; UI review again reports 5/9 issues, plus typo in copy and inconsistent typography. |
| Subsequent steps (Steps 3-9) | ‚ùå pending | Because Step 2 failed, no further interaction occurs‚Äîno interest rate, term, calculation, or result verification. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing primary input field (functional blocker)** | Without the loan-amount field users cannot perform the core task, leading to instant abandonment. | ‚Ä¢ Verify component is rendered for all viewport sizes and on initial page load.<br>‚Ä¢ Add automated smoke test to fail the build if critical form fields are absent.<br>‚Ä¢ Show clear inline error if a required field fails to load. |
| **Visual alignment & spacing** | Clutter and misalignment signal low quality and make scanning harder, raising cognitive load. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a spacing scale (e.g., 4-8-16px) and apply via CSS tokens.<br>‚Ä¢ Use a grid or flexbox layout to align labels, inputs, and buttons uniformly.<br>‚Ä¢ Run visual regression tests to catch spacing drifts. |
| **Hierarchy & typography** | Users rely on size/weight contrast to understand what to read first. Weak hierarchy slows comprehension. | ‚Ä¢ Define H1/H2/body styles in a design system and apply consistently.<br>‚Ä¢ Increase title font size or weight; reduce body copy size for contrast.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit font families and weights to limit to 2-3 purposeful choices. |
| **Button consistency** | Inconsistent buttons erode trust and slow recognition of actionable elements. | ‚Ä¢ Standardize primary/secondary button styles (color, radius, shadow).<br>‚Ä¢ Create reusable button component in codebase.<br>‚Ä¢ Run a quick UI inventory to update rogue styles. |
| **Label‚Äìinput alignment** | Misaligned labels hurt accessibility and can cause form-fill errors. | ‚Ä¢ Use CSS grid or form-layout classes that pair labels and inputs.<br>‚Ä¢ Test with screen readers to ensure correct label association (aria-labelledby). |
| **Copy accuracy (spelling)** | Spelling mistakes appear unprofessional and can confuse users. | ‚Ä¢ Run spell-check in CI or integrate a linter for text strings.<br>‚Ä¢ Have content designer review microcopy before release. |
| **Padding & margin consistency** | Uneven whitespace makes the interface feel unpredictable and can hide elements on smaller screens. | ‚Ä¢ Define global padding/margin variables and enforce via linting or design-token build step. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Render and validate the loan-amount input field on initial load (functional must-have).**
2. **Apply a standard grid/layout to align labels, inputs, and buttons‚Äîquick CSS refactor for immediate visual clarity.**
3. **Standardize primary button styling so the Calculate action is instantly recognizable.**
4. **Fix obvious copy errors (spelling) and set up automated spell-check to prevent regressions.**
5. **Introduce a simple spacing scale (utility classes or tokens) to remove the most glaring padding/margin inconsistencies.**
