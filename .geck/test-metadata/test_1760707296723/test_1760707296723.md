## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A real shopper would start confident when the page loads, but quickly notice visual clutter and poor readability, lowering trust. When they try to enter a loan amount or move a slider and nothing happens (controls missing or unresponsive), confidence turns into confusion, then frustration. Because the task cannot be completed, the user is likely to abandon the calculator, doubting the brand‚Äôs reliability.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Test 1 ‚Äë Loan Calculator Basic Functionality ‚Äì Step 1: Landing on http://localhost:8501 | ‚úÖ pass | Page loads but automated UI review flags 5‚ÅÑ9 visual checks as ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô (mis-alignment, weak hierarchy, inconsistent buttons, uneven padding). |
| Test 1 ‚Äì Step 2: Enter loan amount | ‚ùå fail | Automation cannot locate the loan-amount input field. Hard functional failure that blocks the rest of the flow.; UI review again flags the same visual faults plus a spelling error. |
| Test 1 ‚Äì Steps 3-9 | ‚ùå pending | All subsequent actions (interest rate, term, calculate, verify result, screenshot) are skipped because Step 2 failed. |
| Test 2 ‚Äë Loan Parameter Slider Adjustments ‚Äì Step 1: Landing page | ‚úÖ pass | Same visual problems as Test 1 (misalignment, unclear hierarchy, spelling error). |
| Test 2 ‚Äì Step 2: Verify all sliders are visible | ‚úÖ pass | Automation confirms sliders present, but UI review now shows 7‚ÅÑ9 checks failing (typography, colors, buttons, padding, etc.). |
| Test 2 ‚Äì Step 3: Adjust loan-amount slider | ‚ùå fail | Automation cannot find the loan-amount slider element in the DOM. Hard functional failure blocks remaining steps. |
| Test 2 ‚Äì Steps 4-9 | ‚ùå pending | All further slider adjustments, real-time calc verification and screenshot are skipped because Step 3 failed. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Control discoverability & render reliability (missing input field / slider)** | Core task blockers prevent any calculation and erode trust instantly. | ‚Ä¢ Check front-end rendering logic and element IDs‚Äîensure inputs/sliders mount correctly on all browsers.<br>‚Ä¢ Add automated smoke test that fails build if key DOM elements are absent.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide fallback error messaging if a component fails to load. |
| **Layout alignment, spacing & padding** | Cluttered layouts slow comprehension and make the product look unprofessional. | ‚Ä¢ Apply a grid or flex layout system; standardize spacing tokens.<br>‚Ä¢ Run a visual regression test to catch misalignment before release.<br>‚Ä¢ Conduct quick hallway usability checks to confirm readability. |
| **Visual hierarchy & typography** | Clear hierarchy guides the eye; inconsistent fonts make the page feel unfinished. | ‚Ä¢ Define H1/H2/body styles in a design system and enforce via CSS variables.<br>‚Ä¢ Increase contrast and size of titles; ensure subtitles differ from body text.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit font families and weights for consistency. |
| **Button & component style consistency** | Inconsistent interactive elements confuse users about what is clickable. | ‚Ä¢ Create a shared button component in the UI library; replace ad-hoc buttons.<br>‚Ä¢ Document states (default, hover, disabled) and run a component health checklist. |
| **Form label & input alignment** | Misaligned labels slow data entry and increase input errors. | ‚Ä¢ Use flexbox or grid for label/input pairs; test at common breakpoints.<br>‚Ä¢ Add internal heuristics review before merging UI changes. |
| **Copy accuracy (spelling, punctuation)** | Typos signal lack of care and lower brand credibility. | ‚Ä¢ Run spell-check as part of CI; have content review stage.<br>‚Ä¢ Fix ‚Äòpersons‚Äô ‚Üí ‚Äòperson‚Äôs‚Äô and any other typos immediately. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Restore missing key controls (loan amount input & slider) and add automated tests so they can‚Äôt disappear again.**
2. **Fix obvious copy errors and injection of consistent typography/heading styles to establish basic credibility.**
3. **Apply uniform spacing and alignment via a grid system to remove immediate visual clutter.**
4. **Standardize button component styles to give users clear interactive cues.**
5. **Implement quick visual regression testing to catch future UI drift with minimal effort.**
