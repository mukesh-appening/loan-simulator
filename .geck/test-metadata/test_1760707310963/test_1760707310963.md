## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial curiosity and mild confidence on landing quickly turns to confusion due to visual clutter. Repeated missing elements and typos erode trust. Each hard failure (missing field, missing slider, missing selector, endless loop) spikes frustration and forces abandonment. Overall experience: promising idea overshadowed by usability gaps ‚Üí disappointment.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Loan Calculator Basic Functionality | ‚ùå failed | User lands on home page ‚Äì layout feels cluttered (alignment / spacing issues).; Tries to enter loan amount but the input field is missing ‚Üí hard failure (Step 2).; All following steps (interest, term, calculate, verify) never run. |
| Loan Parameter Slider Adjustments | ‚ùå failed | Home page loads; mis-aligned elements again noticeable.; User sees sliders but visual inconsistency (typography, padding, spelling) lowers confidence.; Attempts to move Loan Amount slider ‚Üí element not found ‚Üí hard failure (Step 3). Remaining slider tests aborted. |
| Multi-Language Support Test | ‚ùå failed | Page opens; same visual flaws (buttons, typo ‚Äúpersons‚Äù).; Site loads but automated check for English text gets stuck, exceeding sub-step limit ‚Üí hard failure (Step 3).; Language-switch workflow never begins. |
| Currency Selection Test | ‚ùå failed | Home page and currency selector supposed to show; user sees layout issues and typo again.; Automation cannot locate currency selector to click ‚Üí hard failure (Step 3).; No currency change or verification occurs. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing or non-discoverable interactive elements (input field, sliders, currency & language controls)** | Primary tasks fail when core controls are absent or lack reliable selectors‚Äîusers cannot progress. | ‚Ä¢ Audit DOM to ensure each critical control is rendered for all viewports.<br>‚Ä¢ Add stable IDs / data-test attributes for automation & accessibility.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide fallback (e.g., text inputs) if sliders fail to mount. |
| **Visual alignment, spacing & hierarchy** | Cluttered layouts slow comprehension and feel unpolished, hurting perceived credibility (especially for financial tools). | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a grid / spacing system (e.g., 8-pt).<br>‚Ä¢ Set consistent margins & padding in global CSS.<br>‚Ä¢ Differentiate headings, sub-headings, body with scalable typographic scale. |
| **Component consistency (buttons, sliders)** | Inconsistent styles make the interface look stitched together and can signal technical debt. | ‚Ä¢ Create a small design system: standard button sizes, corner radius, color states.<br>‚Ä¢ Reuse slider component with unified styling & labels. |
| **Copy accuracy & professionalism (spelling/grammar)** | Financial apps demand trust; typos (‚Äòpersons‚Äô) undermine credibility. | ‚Ä¢ Run content review; integrate spell-check in CI.<br>‚Ä¢ Add content guidelines for future contributors. |
| **Error handling & feedback** | When inputs/controls are missing, users get no explanation, leading to confusion. | ‚Ä¢ Detect DOM render failures and show friendly error (‚ÄúLoan slider failed to load ‚Äì please refresh‚Äù).<br>‚Ä¢ Log client-side errors for QA monitoring. |
| **Automation & test robustness** | Flaky selectors and loops hide real regressions and slow releases. | ‚Ä¢ Refactor tests to wait on stable data-test IDs.<br>‚Ä¢ Set max-retry logic lower and surface in UI logs. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Add stable IDs / data-test attributes and ensure loan amount input, sliders, currency & language controls reliably render.**
2. **Fix obvious copy errors (e.g., change ‚Äúpersons‚Äù to ‚Äúperson‚Äôs‚Äù) and run a quick spelling pass across the app.**
3. **Apply basic CSS grid / spacing tokens to align labels with inputs and normalize padding.**
4. **Standardize button and slider component styles using a mini design system for immediate visual cohesion.**
5. **Implement client-side error message for failed component loads to guide users instead of leaving blank space.**
