## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A real user would start confident once the site loads, but quickly encounter frustration when core fields or controls are missing/unresponsive. Repeated visual clutter and typos erode trust. The single success (chart visualization) offers some relief, but by then overall confidence is low and users may abandon tasks.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch site (all tests) | ‚úÖ pass | The browser opens http://localhost:8501 successfully in every run. |
| Fill or locate primary input controls | ‚ùå fail | Loan Amount input missing in Test: Loan Calculator Basic Functionality.; Loan Amount slider missing in Test: Loan Parameter Slider Adjustments.; Currency selector missing in Test: Currency Selection Test. |
| Interact with secondary features | ‚ùå mixed | Language-switch verification hits max-sub-step loop and stops (Multi-Language Support Test ‚Äì hard fail).; CSV download flow can‚Äôt find generated amortization schedule (CSV Download Test ‚Äì hard fail).; Amortization chart loads and all chart interactions pass (Amortization Chart Visualization Test ‚Äì full pass). |
| UI visual inspection (all steps) | ‚ùå looks off | Recurring ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô flags for alignment, spacing, typography, button consistency, form-label alignment, inconsistent padding/margins, brand colors, and a repeated spelling error ('persons' vs. 'person‚Äôs'). |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing or undetectable UI elements (inputs, sliders, selectors)** | Users cannot complete key tasks if core controls are absent or have no reliable selectors‚Äîresulting in hard drops from the funnel. | ‚Ä¢ Audit DOM to ensure unique, stable IDs or data-test attributes for all interactive elements.<br>‚Ä¢ Verify that components are rendered within viewport on page load‚Äîadd lazy-load guards or default values.<br>‚Ä¢ Add automated smoke test that asserts presence of critical controls before other logic executes. |
| **Visual alignment, spacing & padding** | Inconsistent layout makes the app look unpolished, reduces scannability, and can cause accidental taps on the wrong element‚Äîespecially on mobile. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a design grid or utility classes (e.g., CSS flex/grid with standard spacing tokens).<br>‚Ä¢ Run a quick style-lint pass and add CI linting for spacing variables.<br>‚Ä¢ Use Figma/Storybook to document the canonical spacing for forms and sections. |
| **Typography hierarchy & copy polish** | Poor hierarchy slows comprehension; typos (‚Äòpersons‚Äô) harm credibility. | ‚Ä¢ Define H1‚ÄìH4, body, caption styles in a centralized CSS/Theme.<br>‚Ä¢ Spell-check static copy; add i18n message linting.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure headings use semantic tags for accessibility & SEO. |
| **Button and control consistency** | Mismatched buttons can confuse users about primary vs. secondary actions. | ‚Ä¢ Create a button component with predefined variants (primary, secondary, danger).<br>‚Ä¢ Replace ad-hoc buttons with the component across the codebase. |
| **Feedback when data is loading or absent** | Silent failures (empty schedule, missing sliders) feel like bugs. Explicit empty states keep users oriented. | ‚Ä¢ Show skeleton loaders or ‚ÄòNo data yet‚Äîplease enter X‚Äô messages.<br>‚Ä¢ Log frontend errors to Sentry or console for quicker triage. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Add unique data-test IDs & ensure critical inputs/sliders render on initial load‚Äîunblocks every failing flow.**
2. **Fix the repeated spelling error and establish spell-check in CI‚Äîimmediate credibility boost.**
3. **Implement a basic CSS spacing/typography scale to normalize alignment, padding, and font sizes‚Äîvisible polish with minimal refactor.**
4. **Wrap missing-data states (e.g., amortization schedule) with user-friendly messages or skeleton loaders‚Äîreduces perceived ‚Äòbugs‚Äô.**
5. **Standardize button component and colors to meet brand guidelines‚Äîquick search-and-replace in UI layer.**
